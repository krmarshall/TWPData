Blood and ichor drip from the macabre monument, pooling at its base in a vile puddle of gore.\n\t\n\tBut the Rotten Flesh Larder is more than just a grisly spectacle—it is a source of power for Vorag Bloodytooth, a conduit through which he channels the dark energies of the grave. With a gesture of his hand, Vorag can summon forth the restless spirits of the dead, calling forth swarms of ravenous ghouls to do his bidding.\n\t\n\tAs the ghouls emerge from the depths of the Rotten Flesh Larder, they bring with them the stench of decay and the hunger of the grave. With eyes alight with feral hunger, they descend upon Vorag's enemies with a savage ferocity, tearing flesh from bone in a frenzied frenzy of violence.",
