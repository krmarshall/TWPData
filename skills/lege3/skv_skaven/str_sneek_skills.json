Crafted from the very essence of shadows and honed with the tears of those who have fallen before it, this sinister weapon is wielded by none other than Nightlord Sneek, the cunning and ruthless lord of Clan Eshin.\n\t\n\tThe Reaper of Night is no ordinary blade; its steel is imbued with the essence of the void, granting it an eerie, almost otherworldly presence. Its edge is as sharp as a serpent's fang, capable of slicing through armor and flesh alike with chilling ease. But it is not merely its physical attributes that make the Reaper of Night so fearedâ€”it carries with it a curse that taints the very souls of those it strikes down.\n\t\n\tThose struck by the blade find that all the skill and experience they could once call upon has been rendered naught, stolen from them by Nightlord Sneek and the weeping green toxins of the Reaper of Night.",

Yet, when draped over Nightlord Sneek's wiry frame, it seems to come alive, embracing him in a veil of shifting darkness that obscures his form from prying eyes.\n\t\n\tThe cloak possesses an uncanny ability to meld with the shadows, granting Nightlord Sneek the power to move unseen and unheard amidst the darkest of environs. Its magical properties render him virtually invisible to all but the keenest of senses, allowing him to stalk his prey with unparalleled stealth and precision.\n\t\n\tBut the Umbral Mantle is more than just a tool of concealment; it is also a ward against harm. Woven into its very fibers are enchantments that deflect blades and arrows alike, offering Nightlord Sneek a measure of protection in the midst of battle.",

Its edge is as sharp as a serpent's fang, capable of slicing through armor and flesh alike with chilling ease. But it is not merely its physical attributes that make the Reaper of Night so fearedâ€”it carries with it a curse that taints the very souls of those it strikes down.\n\t\n\tThose struck by the blade find that all the skill and experience they could once call upon has been rendered naught, stolen from them by Nightlord Sneek and the weeping green toxins of the Reaper of Night.",

Yet, when draped over Nightlord Sneek's wiry frame, it seems to come alive, embracing him in a veil of shifting darkness that obscures his form from prying eyes.\n\t\n\tThe cloak possesses an uncanny ability to meld with the shadows, granting Nightlord Sneek the power to move unseen and unheard amidst the darkest of environs. Its magical properties render him virtually invisible to all but the keenest of senses, allowing him to stalk his prey with unparalleled stealth and precision.\n\t\n\tBut the Umbral Mantle is more than just a tool of concealment; it is also a ward against harm. Woven into its very fibers are enchantments that deflect blades and arrows alike, offering Nightlord Sneek a measure of protection in the midst of battle.",
