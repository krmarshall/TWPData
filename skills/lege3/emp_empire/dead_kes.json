Gifts of Nurgle had made Otto immune for damage from common blades. Thus, Stefan went to find the blade of a former champion of Mandred Skavenslayer. This warrior had been slain in battle by a dreaded Vampire, with the sword taken as a trophy. Stefan would go on to fight the Undead Hordes of Waldakir Rahtep. Deep within this Vampire's Sanctum, Stefan finally came face to face with the Necrarch himself. He destroyed the sarcophagi that fuelled the creature's power and claimed the blade.",
