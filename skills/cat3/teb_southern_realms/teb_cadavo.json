In one of the company's campaigns, it was Duke Arrenault's turn to fall in the dust, losing his knights, his feud and his eye to the Tilean pikes.

Arrenault ends up in the New World, growing into the figure of a ruthless mercenary commander, accruing a large retinue of adventurers and even other disillusioned Bretonnians. Almost as he reckoned his resources to be enough for his vendetta, the real Cadavo, also in the New World, gets wind of the impostor. El Cadavo and Arrenault start a slithery game of hunted and hunter until their forces collide under a showering monsoon. The battle is fierce and chaotic, yet the two leaders finally manage to meet each other in a fierce and one-eyed duel in the undergrowth. In the exhausted silence of a dying battle, a fateful pistol shot rings among the rain sprays.",
