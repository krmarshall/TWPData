With every foe claimed, the axe's hunger only deepens, whispering in guttural, wordless fury for more, ever more. Those who fall before its ravenous edge do not simply die - they rise again, though not as warriors. Instead, their skulls are wrenched from their ruined husks, ablaze with hellfire, and hurled forth as fiery missiles of divine wrath. To stand before Krethak in battle is to witness a barrage of burning bone, the faces of the fallen twisted in an eternal rictus of agony as they strike down their former allies with Khorne’s merciless judgment. Every death feeds the carnage, every kill hastens annihilation, until the battlefield itself becomes a writhing altar of bone, fire, and ruin.",
