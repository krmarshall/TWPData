But the intensity of such love itself proved a distraction for the King of Khemri, and he forsook his wife, concubines and royal court to spend more and more time at the Temple of Basth, communing with the High Priestess of the Goddess of Love who in the fullness of time fell pregnant. This lack of attention proved his undoing sadly, as while he was besotted, Khemri’s enemies moved secretly to plot against him. The conspiracy of Zandri and Numas to kill the King and install his much more soft and pliable brother bore fruit on a night of the long knives, the King assassinated on the steps of Basth’s Temple itself. With the twelve in line for the throne before him dead, the King’s brother was set to be crowned and he to reward his benefactors. Then Basth intervened. Outraged at the sacrilege on her temple’s steps, and beseeched by her High Priestess for the power to slay her lovers killers, Basth granted Rasut with blessings usually reserved for her most devoted Ushabti and sent to her feline servants from around Khemri to fight for her cause. A veritable Lioness, the grief stricken Rasut cleansed the royal court of all who stood against Khemri. The heartache and anguish she felt being a channel for her swift daggers and intense magic to do it’s work. With the royal court and the Kings family all dead and in disarray Rasut demanded the throne in the name of her unborn son. With her plans to empower the priesthood and send Khemri’s armies to defend against Zandri and Numas clear, the Mortuary Cult quickly moved to install this clearly blessed by the gods priestess as Khemri’s newest Queen.",

Kept strong and powerful, these hunters are companions and friends but never pets, for their duties include the fierce protection of the priesthood and the Temple grounds. Receiving Hubualtafani as a cub, Rasut hand-reared her lifelong friend until he was a powerful ally. He was by her side throughout her life and upon her death on the battlefield was said to have been called by Basth to the realm of souls itself to join her. No mere animated animal, Rasut calls forth this mighty champion of Basth from the canopic jars holding his remains to come from the spirit realm and fight once again.",

The cats were buried solemnly and at great expense, each not only an enternal companion, but also a sign to Basth of dedication.

As with all Tomb Kings she is sometimes locked into her most extreme memories, reliving a passage of time from her mortal life and thinking it is that time again. Perhaps this is for the best, for while the memory of the passion she felt in life drives her to pinnacles of endless energy, the realisation of what happened to her son after she died drives her to almost immobility. Rasut’s passages of lucidity and open awareness of her current state often lead her to sit for decades at a time barely able to move and heartbroken. In a way Rasut almost welcomes the insanity of the Tomb Kings that sometimes grips her, for at least then she is powerful, vital and an instrument of divine justice. The reality that she died and was unable to protect her son crushes her to an almost endless despair.",
