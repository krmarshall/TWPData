The Directorate is careful to see that no one can meet the conditions. Van der Maacht's possessions are instead used as symbolic tokens of power as the wielders derive legitimacy for their influence by calling themselves the owner of items previously wielded by Van der Maacht. The most important and magical of these items was the Ceremonial Hat of Westerland, this luxurious item was wielded by the Elector Count of Westerland. With pompous feathers and gems it is a sight to be hold and it's worth it's weight in gold.",
