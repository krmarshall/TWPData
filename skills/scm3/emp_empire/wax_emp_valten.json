They were led by the Bestlord Rargarth and his horde was ten times bigger than anything that had come in living memory. They plundered and burnt the village, killing any man they found. Valten on the other hand, refused to die. He smashed his way to his father's forge, picked up two heavy hammers and set about the horde like a possessed man, looking for Rargarth. A violent fight followed, ending with Valten shattering the beastlord skull and the Beastmen retreating in panic. Word of his victory spread quickly and a number of interested parties came to visit him, to learn of the boy who had become a hero.",

It was likely that the people would want Valten to run The Empire, but this was not the time for political change, as Archaon was advancing on the Empire. Luthor pleaded that Emperor Karl Franz step aside to allow Sigmar's Chosen to take his rightful place on the throne. After long consideration, the Emperor refused to step down, but instead gifted Valten with Sigmar's hammer Ghal Maraz. He proclaimed Valten as the spiritual leader of the Empire and vowed to lead the Imperial armies by his side.",
