Whereas the Dwarfen race, although grim and bad-tempered, are essentially a force for order, the Skaven are a thoroughly evil, scheming, nefarious bunch of ratmen, who act accordingly at every given opportunity. Once the ever-enterprising Dwarfs became aware of the Skaven presence beneath their Holds, they immediately got their heads together to come up with ways of beguiling, confounding, and – usually and ideally – killing the despicable ratmen stone dead as efficiently as possible. As such, Dwarf Engineers and Powder Masters have developed a number of substances that, although harmless if ingested by Dawi, are fast-acting and very effective when introduced to Skaven bloodstreams. The method of delivery varies between lobbing canisters of the stuff at enemy lines to carefully lacing water supplies and known feeding spots where ravenous Skaven feeling the Black Hunger gather; the results speak for themselves…",
