A warrior who can survive the slash of an enemy's blade or the blow of their hammer lives to fight another day, and earns more chances to  offer up the lifeblood of his enemies to the Gods. Armour that does not dent or split or buckle must be well-made, and well-made armour needs solid and carefully-crafted anvils. A Marauder whose armour is fashioned with skill wades through the enemy without being distracted by his foes' attempts to wound him - for he is the one doing the wounding!",

The Gods accept the offering of bestial blood almost as eagerly as that flowing from thinking foes - especially when the beast in question is a fearsome monster such as a Manticore or Frost-Wyrm. To hunt a beast, it is necessary to know that beast, its environment, behaviour, diet, etc. After all, you wouldn't want to find yourself facing a most problematic target on unfamiliar, awkward terrain and be at the top of the menu to boot, would you? Therefore, the study of the vicious and twisted creatures of the northern wastes is vital for any who dare stalk them.",
