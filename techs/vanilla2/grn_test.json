A full-grown Gigantic Spider is larger than a Troll, and its whole body is protected by chitinous armour plates. All Gigantic Spiders have a poisonous bite that is used to paralyse their prey. Only the most foolhardy would attempt to seek them out, and Forest Goblin Shamans, with their spectacular lack of common sense, fit well into that category. A gifted Shaman, touched by the Spider-god's blessings, will not be turned into a lifeless husk, but instead may be rewarded with a clutch of spiderlings. This foul brood - each spider already the size of a horse's head - can be reared and trained. When fully grown, these Gigantic Spiders are prized as revered mounts for a Goblin tribe's mightiest warriors."

Hapless victims of a Squig can expect to be bitten clean in two just for starters, with the rest of their short, painful lives occupied by screaming and, well, dying in agony really. As you can imagine, herding a bunch of vicious, hungry Squigs into battle is a bit of a poisoned chalice – getting them vaguely into the right place without being eaten is more than most hapless gobbo handlers can hope to achieve. How utterly, irredeemably bonkers would a Goblin have to be, then, to wilfully ride a Squig into battle? Just hanging on is hard enough, let alone staying alive long enough to attack the foe once battle has been joined!"

Using his wings, the gobbo spirals and guides himself towards the chosen target. As the downward descent gains speed, most Goblins emit a high-pitched scream that grows louder and more irritating as they plummets earthwards. With worrying rapidity, the black speck in the sky expands into the plunging Doom Diver. When the Goblin finally impacts, the Greenskin himself might splatter altogether or, if he has effectively applied his wings as brakes and is a bit lucky, he might bounce. Either way a Doom Diver is likely to cause considerable damage to any foe he lands upon."

Even as boulders splattered their foes, Orcs and Goblins began to wish for some catapults of their own. Since then, the Greenskins have built a plethora of what they generally refer to as “lobbers”. These are deployed either singly or in batteries to soften up enemy formations, smash defensive positions, or to toss those that offend the Warboss very, very far. A great shot, one that pulverises a large amount of the foes or sends body pieces flying particularly high, always raises a rowdy cheer. Most Rock Lobbers are counterweight devices, although some use twisted rope to generate torque. Experiments with Troll-powered devices have been tried, but such creatures tend to eat either the animation or key parts of the machine (or both). Some war engines, especially those that have launched spectacularly bloody shots, are given names, such as the legendary Skull Crusher, Fings Chucker, and Hammer of Gork. The Rock Lobber known as Da Boss’ Bane, named for its habit of landing off target and smashing the tribe’s Warboss, was burned, along with its crew, as a precautionary measure by an unusually bright new leader.",

          "description": "A sane Night Goblin can't lift the great iron balls of the Fanatics, only those with longa chains, driven mad by drinking the fungus brew (the recipe of which is still a closely guarded secret, shared only with other Night Goblin Shamans) have a larger arc of death. Once imbued by the Mad Cap potion, the insanity it creates also brings great strength. The gobbo is given the chained ball and then, when the time is right, unleashed on the battlefield! While the casualties caused will be as random as the direction in which the loony swinger spins, gobbos reason that making the chains longer should increase the number of deaths caused. The downside of all this is that there's a greater chance that the Fanatic will wrap himself up in chain and ball more easily, but then who cares what happens to him in the end anyway?",

A Boar Boy will get the \"right 'ump\" if his mount is shot from under him before he can get a charge in, so they get the gobbos to strap crude barding and even 'eavy metal plates to the beast. This is not a task any Goblin savours, for boars don't welcome being impeded by such cumbersome gear. Wolves and spiders like it even less - a Spider has it's own natural protection with a hardened carapace, and a wolf wants to run free rather than be weighed down. It doesn't stop some Goblins trying to emulate the Boar Boyz though - idiots!",
