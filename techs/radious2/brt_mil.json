The code is not just about a Knight’s behaviour – although that is also important – but also about the choices he makes during his exploits. Living for the moment, a Knight should always choose the most honourable course of action. To them, what matters is what they do now, not what they may or may not do in the future. It is often as simple as seeking battle as a way of securing personal honour and pride.",

This makes for a haphazard economy which does not stockpile goods when it would perhaps be sensible to do so. Generally, trade is what keeps the kingdom going, with nobles dealing with the merchant class when necessary in order to obtain the goods they need and trading wine and textiles in return. Of course, the village communities who do all of the actual production work do not benefit from this – diffusion of wealth being an alien concept in such a staunchly feudal society. Those landowners whose local industries may be suffering simply drive their peasants harder until the profits made are high enough to keep them in the manner to which they are accustomed – as is their noble birthright of course.",

The low-born are far more likely to use a pitchfork to defend their noble’s land than turn it against the noble himself. It also means that when war inevitably comes, he doesn’t have to spend valuable resources on weapons that he could otherwise spend on arming his Knights. Therefore, the high-born know that to give a Bretonnian peasant a pitchfork is to hand him a useful tool with which to work the fields and forearm him for the battles ahead.",

Such loyalty is not reciprocated, however, for if peasants become afflicted by disease or injury to the extent that they can no longer toil the fields or work the looms, they are simply replaced by others in better physical condition. Almshouses provide a modicum of refuge to those wretched individuals who find themselves in such unfortunate predicaments. Such places are not a soft-option though – residents lives remaining hard, they are still expected to work long hours at menial tasks, with barely enough food provided and absolutely no sympathy, cures or palliative care offered.",

By the digging irrigation ditches, water can be directed to man-made watering holes around the foothills, where the pastoral farmers graze their animals, and to the rolling fields where maize and other crops are grown for their masters’ tables.

In times past, men have exploited the forests, harvesting the trees for their selfish ends and have felt the Wood Elves’ wrath in return. As a result, the Bretonnians mostly stay away from Elven lands these days, so as not to tempt fate. For their part, the Elves do not consider the lives of ‘mayflies’ to be worth their time, so generally keep themselves to themselves where possible. There have, however, been instances of co-operation between the two races – for the good of the trees, of course. The Fourth Great Battle saw a horde of filthy, ravening Greenskins putting the forest to the flame and so the noble, courageous Grail Companions came to their aid, stopping the disgusting green tide dead in its tracks.",

Large-scale fabric production is a necessary evil, however, and so the work must be undertaken by hand or with the simplest, hand-driven looms. One effective way of keeping output high enough to meet demand is to increase the size of the spools used; anything further advanced might just trigger an industrial revolution – something no Bretonnian ruler wants to see!",

          "description": "In Bretonnia, the life of anyone outside the ruling class is tough. In keeping with natural order, the nobles take the vast majority of goods produced – and the profits therein – from the peasants who live on their land and do all the physical work. Although their skills are never recognised, weavers and other cloth workers are essential to Bretonnian industry, as the fruits of their labour directly bring income into the kingdom via trade with the travelling merchants that constantly move through the land. Naturally, the nobles do not approve of any activities that take peasants away from their toil, but even they have to admit that passing on knowledge to the next generation is useful – so there is someone to take over when a peasant craftsman eventually drops, exhausted, for the final time.",

For Bretonnians, chivalric virtues are not only expounded through their actions, but also through their appearance. Knights will often wear battle-damaged cloaks as a constant reminder of past glories, and some non-combatant nobles mimic this trend by having slits artificially cut into their own. Unsurprisingly, attempts to fake battle damage are frowned upon – so seamstresses are employed to adorn such cloaks with fabrics provided by the local clothier, making it clear that the battle damage is decorative.",
